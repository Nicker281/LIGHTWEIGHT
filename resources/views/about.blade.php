                    <h1>Sannie</h1>
                    <p>Sannie has been training for 9 years. He found his passion for fitness trough getting bullied as a kid. One day I made the choice of not letting that happen anymore. The gym was and still is my therapy. I love everything about it, the people you meet but also the things you can do that you never thought possible. I love helping people get to their goals. Lightweight for me is the fact that you can get over mental obstacles, because the only limits are the ones you have in your mind.</p>
                    <h1>Big M</h1>
                    <p>Big M is the man that has his goal set. He goes the extra mile to fulfill not only his dreams, but also yours. Do not give up until you achieve your goals, go for it. Dare to dream big. I focus on how to train professionally. Since 2018 I am, on a daily basis, working out on how to create the perfect balance between a healthy diet and a great workout schedule.</p>
